Problem Title: Intersection of Two Circles
==========================================

In order to triangulate a GPS position, we need to solve the mathematical problem of finding the intersection of multiple spheres in 3D space. Let us first solve a simpler problem of finding a location on a 2D plane.

Write a program that receives the (x,y) coordinates of two radio towers on a Cartesian plane. It then receives the distances to each of these two towers, respectively. You can assume all distances are in meters.

Output the (x,y) coordinates of the two points of intersection between the two circles.
