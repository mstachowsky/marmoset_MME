Problem Title: The Case of the Missing Semi-Colon
=================================================

Dave has been working on creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors program. He is almost complete. His program is missing a single, well-placed semi-colon. Help Dave find the missing semi-colon and save the day.

Instructions
------------

1. Start by downloading the file missing_semi-colon.cpp.
2. Try and compile the program.
3. Read the error message from the attempted compilation. The error message should include a statement similar to "Expected ';' after expression." Look for the line number in the error message. This should help you locate where the missing semi-colon should be entered.
4. Open missing_semi-colon.cpp in a text editor and add the missing semi-colon.
5. Try and compile the program again. If the program does not successfully compile, reverse the last change you made to the file and go back to step 3.
6. Once you have successfully compiled the program, run the program to try out the game.
7. Submit your corrected missing_semi-colon.cpp file to the Marmoset project "MME-PROB-01-02, Missing Semi-Colon".
